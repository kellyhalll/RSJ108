Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

There are several things you can do in order to develop a broad knowledge base. First, watch and attend as many sports games as you can. Practice memorizing coach and player names and positions on the team. Also, watch and take notes on interviews with players and coaches in order to learn the kinds of questions journalists ask.</p>

A few solid articles are better than a lot of mediocre pieces. Your writing pieces should represent you and your writing interests. If you have several pieces that cover different sports, categorize them as such. For example, have a separate category for football, tennis, and soccer.</p>
